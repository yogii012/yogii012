A financial institution needs to implement a blockchain-based system to manage
and track assets. The system should support creating assets, updating asset values,
querying the world state to read assets, and retrieving asset transaction history. The
assets represent accounts with specific attributes, such as DEALERID, MSISDN,
MPIN, BALANCE, STATUS, TRANSAMOUNT, TRANSTYPE, and REMARKS. The
institution aims to ensure the security, transparency, and immutability of asset
records, while also providing an efficient way to track and manage asset-related
transactions and histories.
